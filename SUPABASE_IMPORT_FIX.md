# FIXED: Missing Supabase Import

## 🐛 Issue Found

The error in the console was:
```
❌ Exception in useEffect fetching GritSync email: ReferenceError: supabase is not defined
```

## ✅ Root Cause

I added code to fetch from the `supabase` database, but **forgot to import** the `supabase` client!

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Added the missing import to `NCLEXApplication.tsx`:

```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'
```

## 🎯 Result

Now the code can:
1. ✅ Fetch GritSync email from `email_addresses` table
2. ✅ Fallback to `active_email_addresses` view if needed
3. ✅ Display `klcantila@gritsync.com` instead of Gmail

## 🧪 PLEASE TEST AGAIN

1. **Refresh the page:** `http://localhost:5000/application/new`
2. **Check the email field** - Should now show `klcantila@gritsync.com` ✅
3. **Check browser console** - Should now see:

```
🔍 Fetching GritSync email for user ID: cfae7073-0116-47b8-863b-363851958479
🔍 User auth email: kmcantila@gmail.com
📊 Query result: { data: { email_address: 'klcantila@gritsync.com', ... }, error: null }
✅ GritSync email found in useEffect: klcantila@gritsync.com
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED - Ready to test**

The missing import has been added. The page should now correctly fetch and display the GritSync email.
